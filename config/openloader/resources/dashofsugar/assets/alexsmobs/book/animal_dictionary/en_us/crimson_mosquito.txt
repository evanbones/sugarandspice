The Crimson Mosquito is a hideous, mutant flying insect found in the Crimson Forests of the Nether. This voracious beast will
seek out almost any warm-blooded animal as a snack, including people. It first lunges at its prey, and latches on, sucking
them dry. Once it has had its fill, it will begin to fly and use its prey's blood against it - spitting it back at the
target.

If an overworld, garden variety fly happens to find itself in the nether, it can transform into a Crimson Mosquito.
